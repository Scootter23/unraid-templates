* Dockhand is a modern, efficient Docker management application providing real-time container management, Compose stack orchestration, and multi-environment support.

* This version is called "Quantum" because it packs tons of advanced features into a tiny easy to run file. Unlike the majority of alternative options, FileBrowser Quantum is simple to install and easy to configure.
